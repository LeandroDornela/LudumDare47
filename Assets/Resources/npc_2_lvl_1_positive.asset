  - "You watch the birds flying from the boss room. A feeling of freedom crosses
    your mind as you forget what you were there for.\r"
  - "BOSS: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WANT TO JUMP?\r"
  - "The boss picks his telephone and calls someone.\r"
  - "BOSS: KAREN, INSTALL SOME BARS ON THOSE WINDOWS! I NEED IT TODAY!\r"
  - "You: Sorry, Sir. Thought I could talk to you?\r"
  - "BOSS: AND YOU'RE NOT?\r"
  - "You: Um, can I get a raise, please?\r"
  - "The volume of your voice is so low nothing comes out of your mouth except for
    a muffled mumbling.\r"
  - "BOSS: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?\r"
  - "WELL, SINCE YOU'RE HERE, DELIVER THESE PAPERS TO KAREN.\r"
  - "NOW GET OUT, YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW.\r"
  - You leave the boss room without saying anything, carrying a pile of paper and
    wondering why you were blocking his view if he is not even that tall to see through
    the window.
