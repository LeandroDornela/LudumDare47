    \r"
  - "You pick it up quickly before anyone sees it. It's heavy. Like there a stapler
    inside it. \r"
  - "You smile as you throw it on Karen's head. The paper ball falls like a brick
    and the sound draws everyone's attention. \r"
  - "You hear Karen's inflection of pain. \r"
  - "She turns to you. Her face turned into a mask of fury. \r"
