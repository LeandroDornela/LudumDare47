  - "You look at your own table and see a mess. You're almost sure your keyboard
    is under there somewhere.\r"
  - "Looking at the pile of garbage you call your desk, you realize you feel just
    like that:\r"
  - "trash...\r"
  - "Your life is a mess and consists basically of pilled up work.\r"
  - "When did things go south?\r"
  - "You wonder about how you ended up in an office, doing something that displeases
    you so much.\r"
  - "While you're at it, you decide to tidy your desk.\r"
