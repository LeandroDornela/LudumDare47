  - "You stop for a moment as your brain seems to burst all of a sudden.\r"
  - "The epiphany hits you like a train and you halt where you stand.\r"
  - "You look at the clock, expecting the day to go back to the beginning of your
    sift again.\r"
  - "Somehow you know deep down it won't.\r"
  - "As you wonder why, you start answering your own question.\r"
  - "Your torment is over...\r"
  - "Not having relations with the people you worked with is over...\r"
  - "Cowardice is over...\r"
  - "Bringing yourself down is over...\r"
  - "You realize you're starting to like yourself.\r"
  - 'That you couldn''t care less about the shitty boss of the company. He''s not
    YOUR boss!

'
  - "You remember you once had dreams and the will to run after them again starts
    to grow inside you.\r"
  - "To hell with this job and this torment! You're going to search for your happiness.\r"
  - As you show the finger to your boss, you walk out the door at the end of the
    shift. Never to go back.
  - "You invite Karen and jack to go to the first happy hour of the rest of your
    life!\r"
  - Enjoy!
