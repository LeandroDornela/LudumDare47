  - "You enter the warehouse and see that it's a mess. \r"
  - "You wonder how anyone can work in a place like that.\r"
  - "Looking among the piles of boxes you see a bedroll, a tv, a camping stove, and
    some lights.\r"
  - "It looks like someone is also living in that mess!\r"
  - "Since your boss is always complaining you feel like you should clean that up.
    \r"
  - "Maybe that will show him how valuable you are and raise your salary!\r"
  - "You spend hours on the task.\r"
  - "The result is: papercuts, backpain, sweaty clothes, and your boss complaining
    about how you didn't do your job.\r"
  - That's what you get for thinking that douche would value your work...
