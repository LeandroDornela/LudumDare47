  - "You walk confidently, moving towards the boss room. \r"
  - "As you approach you clench your fist stronger than never before, ready to ask
    to leave earlier. Instead of doing after-hours... again! \r"
  - "You just stand there, without the smallest hunch of how to say it.\r"
  - "BOSS: HEY YOU! YES, YOU! I NEED YOUR HELP, STAY A BIT LATER TODAY, OK? THERE
    ARE SOME FILES THAT I NEED FILLED FOR TOMORROW.\r"
  - "BOSS: HOPE YOU GET IT DONE QUICKLY.\r"
  - "You: Okay, sir. I'll do what I can today!\r"
  - "You leave his room planning to leave half of the work for another day.\r"
  - "After all, he never needs or even look at the files.\r"
  - His pleasure, you know, comes from issuing dumb orders.
