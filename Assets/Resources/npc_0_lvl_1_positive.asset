  - "You approach Jack that seems very stressed already from being back at work.\r"
  - "You: Oh... Hey Jack. Sorry to disturb you...\r"
  - "He looks away from his monitor, surprised by seeing you there.\r"
  - "He smiles.\r"
  - "Jack: Hey buddy! Thanks for taking my mind off work. What's going on?\r"
  - "You: I wanted to thank you for the souvenir. It's great. Really. Thank you.\r"
  - "Jack: Hahah no worries, man. We're good. What did you wish for, by the way?\r"
  - "You: Well...\r"
  - "You stutter, feeling a little ashamed of your wish.\r"
  - "You: ... I wished for this to be my last day on this torment...\r"
  - "You shrug your shoulders, feeling a little stupid saying it out loud.\r"
  - "Jack looks at you perplexed.\r"
  - "Jack: Hahah me too, brother! Me too!\r"
  - "Seeing Jack laugh takes a weight off your chest.\r"
  - "Jack: But you know? It's your power to do that. Aim towards your happiness,
    man!\r"
  - "You're surprised by Jack's words. You never imagined he would think like that.\r"
  - "He IS a friend after all, so that does make sense.\r"
  - "You: Thanks, Jack! I needed to hear that.\r"
  - "He laughs and gives you a thumbs up.\r"
  - "Jack: You got it! But you know, it's all you, brother. Find yourself inside
    there and go for it!\r"
  - You leave, wondering about what "finding yourself" means...
